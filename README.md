# Professors Guild DAO Tokenomics & Governance  
  
## Guild Overview  
Professors Guild DAO is an investment and application development DAO on the Cardano blockchain. Anyone can join and participate in the DAO by holding a Member NFT.  
  
 Members of the DAO share in profits derived from applications which are built by, and/or invested in, by the organization. As well as early access to emerging products and services in the Cardano NFT ecosystem.  
 
 One can view [professorsguild.app/blog](https://professorsguild.app/blog) for updates and information and most discussions and events are held in the [guild discord server]()  
   
 ## Roles in the guild community  
 - **Core Team**  
 The core team consists of founding members of the DAO. Additionally any member can be voted to the core team provided they have made substantial contributions to the organization.  
 - **Member**  
 All persons who hold a member NFT and governance tokens will be voting members of the DAO.  
 - **Customer:**  
 All persons who enjoy the DAOs services or products are customers. For example an NFT project looking for start up funding, any user of systems or processes developed by or powered by the DAO, as well as any person passing through our information & research portals.
 - **$GUILD**  
 A fungible governance token which will be used alongside our membership NFTs in order to vote on DAO proposals. It ensures the autonomy and sustainability of our ecosystem.
 - **DAO Treasury**  
 The DAO treasury will act as a relay station controlling the flow of funds through our ecosystem. 
  
## Governance & Phases  
Professors Guild DAO is owned and governed by its holders and governance will pass through phases. Our initial policy is for the following actions to be executed only after a successful proposal and vote:  
- Funding of CNFT project
- Funding of application  
- Additions to the core team 
- Treasury allocation
- Updates to DAO protocols & management  
- 
### Governance Phase 1  
In this phase the core team is responsible for almost everything. Tokenomics, minting, community organization and social media. We expect this phase to last until the end of March 2022. Voting will be conducted through discord or an in-house solution crafted by the team and decisions made will be enforced through the core team.
  
### Governance Phase 2  
In this phase we will deploy a smart contract based voting system. (such system is currently in development). In general, the decisions via voting will still be enforced by the core team at this phase while the distribution of tokens, and subsqequently decentralization, increases.  

### Governance Phase 3  
Full decentralization and autonomy. Our smart contact voting system will enforce the decisions made on DAO proposals. Treasury funds are expected to flow freely without the need for oversight or additional enforcement.
